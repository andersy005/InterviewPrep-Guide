# Interview Prep Grid
This repository contains the development for a preparation tool 
to interviewees and students in the field of Computer Science, 
or otherwise similar fields. 

The goal of the webpage is to offer a reference tool which will 
point users in the right direction for the subject they need 
to brush up on--without wasting a lot of time searching for 
the right learning resources on their own.
