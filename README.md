# Interview Prep Guide 
This repository contains the development for a preparation tool 
to interviewees and students in the field of Computer Science, 
or otherwise similar fields. 

The goal of the webpage is to offer a reference tool which will 
point users in the right direction for the subject they need 
to brush up on--without wasting a lot of time searching for 
the right learning resources on their own.

The material covered consists of general computer science knowledge and can be implemented in any programming language 
of your choice. However, we focus on three popular technical interview programming languages namely **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**.
